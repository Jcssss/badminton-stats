# Badminton Data Scraper
A responsive website that scrapes data from the official Badminton World Federation website using an Express backend and the Javascript Puppeteer module. The data is then displayed using React and the Javascript Regraph library. Displayed data includes player performance history, overall rank distributions, and more.

## About
Having actively played badminton for the past 10 years, I've always enjoyed following the professional scene. Originally, I had wanted to build a website that would allow me to answer several complex queries such as "How does a player perform in matches that last 3 games, compared to matches that only last 2?" Unfortunately, I couldn't find an API or website that had this data, and so, I decided to aquire the data myself. This is what ultimately led me to create a web scraper.
